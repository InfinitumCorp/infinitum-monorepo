# ✦ Conjure

Conjure turns a one-line intent ("a pomodoro timer with a task list") into a small, **working, verified** deliverable: a folder of files that opens and runs. It is built on Claude (`claude-opus-5-5` by default) through the official Anthropic SDK.

## @conjure in Infinitum products

Conjure is not a consumer product. It is the model that runs inside Infinitum products: anyone types **@conjure** and a question (`@conjure will Northwind sign by March?`) and gets a live prediction. A swarm of AI agents plays the question out over a few rounds and a report agent writes the forecast.

- **Engine.** The prediction engine lives in Infinitum Nexus (`@infinitum/conjure`). `node scripts/sync-nexus.mjs` copies it into `src/predict/vendor/`, so this service runs exactly the code products import.
- **API for products** (`/v1`, product key as `Authorization: Bearer cjp_<product>_…`): `POST /v1/predictions` {question, context, user, source, agents, rounds} → 202; `GET /v1/predictions/:id`; `GET /v1/predictions/:id/events` (live, server-sent events); `POST /v1/predictions/:id/interview`; `POST /v1/predictions/:id/cancel`; `GET /v1/health`. Each product sees only its own forecasts and has a daily limit.
- **Client.** `client/conjure.mjs` (no dependencies; types in `conjure.d.mts`). Products call `handleMention(text)`; it returns null when there's no @conjure. Nexus products use the same contract from `@infinitum/conjure`.
- **Staff dashboard** (`/`, private). Sign in with Cumulus ID ("Create a Cumulus ID" is on the same screen). The owner is whoever is in `CID_OWNERS`; admins add staff by their Cumulus ID email or CID. Status, a "Try @conjure" console with live rounds, every forecast across products, product keys (issue, rotate, revoke) and staff (admins add and revoke people). Tokens and keys are stored hashed and shown once. The builder studio moved to `/studio`.
- **Offline.** Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` forecasts run on a deterministic mock and are labelled "mock".

Data (staff, keys, forecasts, `usage.jsonl`) is kept in `CONJURE_DATA` (default `./conjure-data`; `/var/lib/conjure-data` on AWS), never under the preview folder.

## How it works

```
intent ──► PLAN ──► FORGE ──► VERIFY ──► DELIVER
            │         ▲          │
            │         └─ REPAIR ◄┘  (failures fed back, up to 3 rounds)
            └─ structured JSON plan: name, files, acceptance criteria
```

| Phase   | What happens | Code |
|---------|--------------|------|
| Plan    | One Claude call with a JSON-schema structured output. Returns the product name, file list and acceptance criteria. | `src/engine.js` |
| Forge   | An agentic tool loop: Claude calls `write_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`, `run_checks` and `finish`. | `src/engine.js` |
| Verify  | Deterministic checks: JS syntax (`node --check`, inline `<script>` blocks included), JSON validity, HTML structure (title, viewport, balanced scripts), CSS balance, every local `src`/`href`/`url()`/`import` pointing to a real file, and every planned file present. Generated code is never executed. | `src/verify.js` |
| Repair  | Failed checks go back to Claude as the `finish` tool result, and it fixes them. | `src/engine.js` |
| Deliver | Writes `conjure.json` (plan, verification results, token usage, cost estimate, timing, change history) and `transcript.jsonl` (every event of every run) next to the output. | `src/engine.js` |
| Refine  | Applies a follow-up change to an existing deliverable through the same forge, verify and repair loop, and appends it to `conjure.json` history. | `src/engine.js` |

Runs can be cancelled with Ctrl+C in the CLI or the **Stop** button in the UI; the in-flight API request is aborted and the transcript is still saved. In the web UI a run keeps going if the browser disconnects (for example a phone screen locks): the page shows it as in progress when you come back, and the result lands in History. Set `CONJURE_ABORT_ON_DISCONNECT=1` to cancel on disconnect instead. Cost estimates use list prices in `src/pricing.js`. Milestones are tracked in [MILESTONES.md](MILESTONES.md).

**Safety:** model-supplied paths are confined to the deliverable's folder (`src/workspace.js`), with file-size and file-count limits. Tool inputs are validated before they run. Refusals are surfaced, not ignored. Server-side refusal fallback is on (`fallbacks: "default"`); set `CONJURE_FALLBACKS=0` to turn it off. The web UI listens on 127.0.0.1 only and serves conjured output from a separate port, so generated code can't call the Conjure API.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm test                                          # 44 tests, offline
node src/cli.js "a habit tracker"                 # build something new
node src/cli.js refine conjured/<folder> "add dark mode"   # change it
node src/cli.js zip conjured/<folder>                      # package it as a .zip
node src/cli.js list                              # list deliverables, newest first
npm start                                         # web UI at http://localhost:4317
```

With no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, Conjure uses the **mock provider**: a scripted stand-in that returns responses in the same shape as the real API, so the whole pipeline runs offline. For live Claude, put the key in `.env` (git-ignored; see `.env.example`), or run `set-key.ps1` to enter it without it showing on screen.

CLI flags: `--mock`, `--model <id>`, `--out <dir>`, `--flaw` (mock only: injects a bug to show the repair loop), `-q`.

Environment variables: `CONJURE_MODEL`, `CONJURE_OUT` (default `./conjured`), `CONJURE_FALLBACKS`, `CONJURE_TIMEOUT_MS` (per API request), `CONJURE_MAX_RETRIES` (default 3; retries rate limits, overloads and connection errors), `CONJURE_MOCK=1`, `CONJURE_MOCK_DELAY` (ms per mock turn, for testing Stop), `PORT`, `PREVIEW_PORT`.

## On your phone

**Install as a web app (PWA):** open the UI in the phone's browser and choose *Add to Home screen*; it ships a manifest and icons.

**Android app:** `android/` holds a small WebView app (`com.conjure.app`), built without Gradle:

```bash
bash android/build.sh                               # -> android/build/conjure.apk (needs Android SDK + JDK)
CONJURE_URL=https://app.<ip>.sslip.io bash android/build.sh   # same, opening your AWS server by default
adb install -r android/build/conjure.apk
adb reverse tcp:4317 tcp:4317 && adb reverse tcp:4318 tcp:4318
npm start                                           # the app opens http://localhost:4317 on the phone
```

To point the app at another server: use **Use this server** on its "Can't reach Conjure" screen, or `adb shell am start -n com.conjure.app/.MainActivity --es url http://host:4317/` (remembered). Zip downloads go to the phone's Downloads folder and carry the sign-in session.

## Deploy to AWS

`deploy/aws/` runs Conjure on one EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2023, `t4g.small` by default, roughly $15/month with its Elastic IP). Caddy serves it over HTTPS on two free `sslip.io` hostnames: `app.<ip>.sslip.io` for the UI and `preview.<ip>.sslip.io` for previews, so generated code stays on a separate origin.

```bash
aws configure                          # or: aws sso login   (AWS CLI v2)
node deploy/aws/deploy.mjs --profile infinitum   # first run creates everything; later runs roll out the working tree
node deploy/aws/deploy.mjs --status    # URL and stack state
node deploy/aws/deploy.mjs --destroy --yes
```

- **Sign-in:** the first deploy generates an access token, stores it in SSM Parameter Store (`/conjure/access-token`) and saves a copy to `.conjure-access-token` (git-ignored). With `CONJURE_ACCESS_TOKEN` set, every page and API call needs a session: people get one by signing in with Cumulus ID at `/login` (set `CID_OWNERS`, and `CONJURE_PUBLIC_URL` so the redirect is `<url>/auth/cid/callback`; `CID_ISSUER` can point at a mirror that loads in Russia). Scripts may still send the token as `Authorization: Bearer`; cross-site and non-JSON POSTs are refused.
- **Live mode:** if `.env` has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the deploy stores it as `/conjure/anthropic-api-key`; without it the server runs in offline mock mode.
- **Previews:** the preview host serves only a deliverable's own files (never `conjure.json` or `transcript.jsonl`) and needs no sign-in, so anyone with a deliverable's exact URL can open it. Folder names carry a random suffix.
- **Data:** deliverables live on the instance's disk (`/var/lib/conjure`) and are deleted with the stack.
- **No SSH:** port 22 is closed; use SSM Session Manager. The template (`deploy/aws/conjure.yaml`) builds its own VPC, so it doesn't depend on a default VPC.
- **Android:** `adb shell am start -n com.conjure.app/.MainActivity --es url https://app.<ip>.sslip.io/`

## Evaluate it

`eval/intents.json` holds five representative requests (three web apps, a Node CLI script, a live-preview tool). The harness runs each through Conjure and writes `eval-report.md` and `eval-results.json` with pass rate, repair rounds, tokens and estimated cost.

```bash
npm run eval -- --mock                 # offline check of the harness (free)
npm run eval -- --yes                  # live against Claude (spends API credit)
npm run eval -- --only todo,markdown --yes
```

A live run without `--yes` stops and tells you what it would do, so the eval never spends credit by accident.

## Use as a library

```js
import { conjure } from "./src/engine.js";
import { ClaudeProvider } from "./src/providers.js";

const result = await conjure({
  intent: "a unit converter",
  provider: new ClaudeProvider(),
  outDir: "./conjured",
  onEvent: (e) => console.log(e.type),
});
console.log(result.workspace, result.verification.ok);
```

A provider is any object with `turn({system, messages, tools, jsonSchema, effort, onText})` that returns an Anthropic-shaped message. Add a provider to plug in another backend.
